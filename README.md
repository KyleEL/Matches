# Matches
The idea is having the basic card matching game. Pick two cards and see if its a match.

I'm still new to programming as I just started learning a few months back.

So when I inspect element on my browser this is what I get:

<html data-brackets-id="1" lang="en">
 <head data-brackets-id="2">
   <meta data-brackets-id="3" charset="UTF-8">
   <meta data-brackets-id="4" name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
   <meta data-brackets-id="4" name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
   <title data-brackets-id="6">JavaScript Memory Game</title>
   <link data-brackets-id="7" rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
 </head>
   <body data-brackets-id="8">
    <div data-brackets-id="9" id="game-board"></div>
    <script data-brackets-id="10" src="main.js"></script>

 </body>
</html> 

data-brackets-id="" started appearing and I don't know why. I searched and figured out that turning off
 Live preview on Brackets removes them.

My problem is the div card I created won't appear. And on the tutorial the picture should appear at my
 browser but with my code it still won't appear. I followed the steps as is and I still don't know what
 I'm doing wrong.
 
I don't know if I just overlooked something or this might be just a newbie problem but I don't have anyone
 else to ask.
